Watched video

Watched Andrew Ng Coursera videos on logistic regression.

Built intuition of log loss:
https://github.com/dsikar/msc-dissertation/blob/master/notebooks/LogLoss.ipynb

Computed derivative of log loss function, and sigmoid function with some pointers from:
https://www.symbolab.com/solver/derivative-calculator/ 
and
https://medium.com/analytics-vidhya/derivative-of-log-loss-function-for-logistic-regression-9b832f025c2d
and
https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/2623822/how-to-get-the-loss-function-derivative

Todo - done, results to follow

Do algebraic manipulations to reach:

df/da * da/dz (-y/a + (1-y)/(1-a))*a(1-a) = a-y
